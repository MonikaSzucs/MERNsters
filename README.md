# MERNsters
This is a MERN stack that was created for the Hack the Break Event at BCIT on March 12 - 13th (24 hour event)


## What Inspired Us
We were inspired by creating a MERN stack app which was able to use an API and grab events. We thought that grabbing events from a live natural disaster event would help inform others what is going on in the world.

## How we built it 
We built it using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) which was hosted on GitHub. We as a team just used GitHub Desktop to push and pull the changes that everyone did. 

## Challenges We Ran Into
The challenges we ran into was trying to make the Object that was displaying in the console log to show up on the screen itself. At first Monika was able to grab individual pieces of the object but that would make things inefficent. This is why we tried to use map to loop through all the events. We were not able to display those events though on the page. Additionally, we ran out of time when it came to setting up the database. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how we were able to understand how the API url works, how we can at least see the object within the console and set up the various pages that were needed. 

## What We Learned
We learned how to set up an API using fetch and Axios, grab the information and display it in the console log, how to set up pages using react, using .map function, setState and useState. Additionally, we learned how to work within a team, communicate and plan how to do various tasks on a project. 

## What's next for MERNsters Nasa WebApp
We will just be working on figuring out how to fix the current functionality of displaying the events on the screen.
